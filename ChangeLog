New features
  Add extracheckports option to allow loop checking when cache if front.
  Add new semi exception lists and flag - allows reverse logic for selected sites
     i.e. Trust a site - but block some urls within site.
     Note: semiexceptionsitelist and blockurllist must be of the same type to work
        so if site is in localsemiexceptionsitelist then block of url will only work if in localblockurllist
        or if in semiexceptionsitelist the block of url will only work if in blockurllist
